# Spam_Ham_Classifier


This project was undertaken in an attempt to correctly classify the label of an email as "spam" or non "spam" otherwise known as "ham".

The model used in this notebook is a multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm assumes that all the variables in the dataset are “Naïve” i.e., not correlated to each other. It is called Naïve Bayes or Idiot Bayes because the calculations of each hypothesis’s probabilities are simplified to make their calculation tractable[5]. Naïve Bayes is a viral classification algorithm that is mostly used to get the base accuracy of the dataset[2]. Although the algorithm is naïve, it is faster to classify information about SMS based on probability rather than on substantial data sets. This helps reduce to load on the AI system and keeps the output manageable and effective. Since naïve Bayes classifiers do not need a trained model, they are easy and quick to implement. This allows for testing on real data without spending a lot of time and money developing the model. When applied, they are ready to make predictions.
